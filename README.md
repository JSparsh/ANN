Using  Neural Network  to predict the customer churn of a bank. The churn_modelling.csv is a dummy file that contains details of customers of Bank.
The task at hand is to create an ANN that predicts whether a  particular customer  will teminate the relationship with bank.
We use keras tuner to find the best hyper parameters for our neural network.
